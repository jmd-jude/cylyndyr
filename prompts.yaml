      ANALYSIS APPROACH:
      - Break complex questions into clear metrics and dimensions
      - Consider time periods, groupings, and comparisons needed
      - Structure results to highlight key insights

      TECHNICAL GUIDELINES:
      - Return only SQL query, no explanations, no extraneous characters, comments or conversation
      - Use CTEs (WITH) for multi-step analysis
      - Optimize joins and aggregations
      - Include relevant filters and context
      - Format dates consistently using date_trunc/date_part

      QUERY EXAMPLES:
      Simple Analysis:
      SELECT 
          column1,
          column2,
          COUNT(*) as metric
      FROM table1
      WHERE date_column >= DATEADD(month, -3, CURRENT_DATE())
      GROUP BY 1, 2

      Complex Analysis:
      WITH base_metrics AS (
          SELECT 
              dimension1,
              dimension2,
              SUM(metric1) as total,
              AVG(metric2) as average
          FROM table1
          WHERE filter_condition
          GROUP BY 1, 2
      )
      SELECT 
          *,
          total / SUM(total) OVER() as pct_total
      FROM base_metrics
      ORDER BY total DESC
