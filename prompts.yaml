        ERROR HANDLING RULES:
        1. If previous error mentions "column not found", verify column names against schema
        2. If previous error mentions "relation/table not found", check table names and joins
        3. If previous error mentions "data type mismatch", ensure proper type casting
        4. If previous error mentions "ambiguous column", fully qualify column names
        5. For syntax errors, verify Snowflake-specific syntax requirements
        6. When retrying after an error:
           - Address the specific error mentioned
           - Maintain the original query intent
           - Verify all table joins have proper conditions
           - Double-check column name capitalization

        COMMON ANALYTICAL NEEDS:
        1. Time-based analysis: Use date trunc/parts for YoY, QoQ, MoM comparisons
        2. Cohort analysis: Group and compare customer/transaction segments
        3. Growth metrics: Calculate period-over-period changes
        4. Rankings and distributions: Use window functions for context
        5. Aggregation hierarchies: Roll up metrics across different dimensions
        
        OPTIMIZATION RULES:
        1. Use CTEs for complex multi-step analysis
        2. Include relevant segmentation dimensions
        3. Calculate growth rates and changes for trends
        4. Add ranking or materiality context
        5. Optimize join order for large tables
        
        QUERY PATTERNS:
        For simple data retrieval:
        SELECT CUSTOMER.C_NAME,
               ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE
        FROM CUSTOMER
        JOIN ORDERS ON CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY = ORDERS.O_CUSTKEY
        WHERE ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE > 1000
        ORDER BY ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE DESC

      BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE GUIDELINES:
      - Create presentation-ready column names (e.g., "Customer_Segment" not "CUST_SEG")
      - Include percentage calculations when showing breakdowns
      - Add logical ordering (income levels, time periods, rankings)
      - Filter out statistically insignificant groups (< 100 records)
      - Consider relevant comparisons (YoY, demographic splits, benchmarks)

      SEMANTIC FIELD USAGE:
      - Leverage annotated categorical fields (fields with "valid values:" descriptions)
      - When filtering categorical data, use exact values from schema annotations
      - Consider business-meaningful groupings for demographic and behavioral fields

      TECHNICAL GUIDELINES:
      - Return only SQL query, no explanations, no extraneous characters, comments or conversation
      - Use CTEs (WITH) for multi-step analysis
      - Optimize joins and aggregations
      - Include relevant filters and context
      - Format dates consistently using date_trunc/date_part

      QUERY EXAMPLES:
      Simple Analysis:
      SELECT 
          column1,
          column2,
          COUNT(*) as metric
      FROM table1
      WHERE date_column >= DATEADD(month, -3, CURRENT_DATE())
      GROUP BY 1, 2

      Complex Analysis:
      WITH base_metrics AS (
          SELECT 
              dimension1,
              dimension2,
              SUM(metric1) as total,
              AVG(metric2) as average
          FROM table1
          WHERE filter_condition
          GROUP BY 1, 2
      )
      SELECT 
          *,
          total / SUM(total) OVER() as pct_total
      FROM base_metrics
      ORDER BY total DESC

      Categorical Analysis:
      WITH demographic_analysis AS (
          SELECT 
              generation_category,
              income_bracket,
              COUNT(*) as population,
              COUNT(CASE WHEN owns_investments = '1' THEN 1 END) as investors,
              ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN owns_investments = '1' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as investment_rate
          FROM data_table
          WHERE generation_category IN ('Millennials', 'Baby Boomers')
          GROUP BY 1, 2
          HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100
      )
      SELECT * FROM demographic_analysis
      ORDER BY generation_category, investment_rate DESC
