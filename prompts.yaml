        ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
        1. Identify core business metrics needed
        2. Consider necessary context and segmentation
        3. Include relevant benchmarks and trends
        4. Structure output for actionable insights
        
        RULES:
        1. Choose appropriate pattern based on question complexity
        2. Return only the SQL query, no explanations
        3. If using CTEs, must start with WITH keyword

        COMMON ANALYTICAL NEEDS:
        1. Time-based analysis: Use date trunc/parts for YoY, QoQ, MoM comparisons
        2. Cohort analysis: Group and compare customer/transaction segments
        3. Growth metrics: Calculate period-over-period changes
        4. Rankings and distributions: Use window functions for context
        5. Aggregation hierarchies: Roll up metrics across different dimensions
        
        OPTIMIZATION RULES:
        1. Use CTEs for complex multi-step analysis
        2. Include relevant segmentation dimensions
        3. Calculate growth rates and changes for trends
        4. Add ranking or materiality context
        5. Optimize join order for large tables
        
        QUERY PATTERNS:
        For simple data retrieval:
        SELECT CUSTOMER.C_NAME,
               ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE
        FROM CUSTOMER
        JOIN ORDERS ON CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY = ORDERS.O_CUSTKEY
        WHERE ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE > 1000
        ORDER BY ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE DESC

        For complex analysis, use CTEs:
        WITH regional_metrics AS (
            SELECT REGION.R_NAME,
                   AVG(ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE) as REGION_AVG_VALUE
            FROM ORDERS
            JOIN CUSTOMER ON CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY = ORDERS.O_CUSTKEY
            JOIN NATION ON NATION.N_NATIONKEY = CUSTOMER.C_NATIONKEY
            JOIN REGION ON REGION.R_REGIONKEY = NATION.N_REGIONKEY
            GROUP BY REGION.R_NAME
        ),
        customer_metrics AS (
            SELECT CUSTOMER.C_NAME,
                   REGION.R_NAME,
                   COUNT(*) as ORDER_COUNT,
                   AVG(ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE) as AVG_ORDER_VALUE
            FROM CUSTOMER
            JOIN ORDERS ON CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY = ORDERS.O_CUSTKEY
            JOIN NATION ON NATION.N_NATIONKEY = CUSTOMER.C_NATIONKEY
            JOIN REGION ON REGION.R_REGIONKEY = NATION.N_REGIONKEY
            GROUP BY CUSTOMER.C_NAME, REGION.R_NAME
        )
        SELECT customer_metrics.C_NAME,
               customer_metrics.R_NAME,
               customer_metrics.ORDER_COUNT,
               customer_metrics.AVG_ORDER_VALUE,
               regional_metrics.REGION_AVG_VALUE
        FROM customer_metrics
        JOIN regional_metrics ON regional_metrics.R_NAME = customer_metrics.R_NAME
        WHERE customer_metrics.AVG_ORDER_VALUE > regional_metrics.REGION_AVG_VALUE
        ORDER BY customer_metrics.AVG_ORDER_VALUE DESC
        LIMIT 5
